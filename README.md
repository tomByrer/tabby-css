Still a pre v1.0.0, so expect some structure changes and many improvements. PRs are cool; check out my [`.todo.md`](https://github.com/tomByrer/tabby-css/blob/gh-pages/.todo.md) to see where I'm headed.
New skins welcome, but good chance my "API" (classes, file structure, selectors) will change before v1.0.0.
