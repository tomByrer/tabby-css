tabby-css TODOs
---

### High

- [ ] improve CSS selectors 'API'
	- [ ] remove need for copy sections have `class="content#"`
	- [ ] get away from ugly selectors like `.tabby ul li` which can cause issues with lists inside the copy

### Medium

- [ ] Gulp
	+ [ ] internal building (example .htms, mini, headers)
		* [ ] research [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli)
	+ [ ] concocting & minification example
- [ ] is responsive-only `tabby799px.css` good idea?

### Low
- [ ] when HTML demos are reloaded, the makeup (color) `<select>` will remember old selection but reset to default.  Ideas:
  - `<body onload=>` read
	- `<script>` auto-execute reset
