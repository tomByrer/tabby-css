				<h1>What is tabby-css?</h1>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/tomByrer/tabby-css.git" title="tabby-css GitHub repo">tabby-css</a> is a fork of <a href="http://jasonshi.gweb.io/truetabs.htm">Jason Shi's TrueTabs</a> CSS3 tabbed content switcher.
					<a href="http://codepen.io/JustAnotherCoder/pen/gIqtp">Jason's CodePen</a> is excellent, but I wanted to make the CSS more modular.
					So I separated the basic functionality, and moved design flourishes into separate CSS files.
					I also removed the need to change classes to change design; design changes happen in the CSS.
					The basic functionality is provided by <code>tabby.css</code>,
					base layout design, fonts and main animations are provided by <code>tabby-{LAYOUT}-.css</code>,
					and color skinning and flourishes ('makeup') are in a separate CSS file named as <code>tabby--{MAKEUP}.css</code>.
					To demonstrate, try clicking around down here:
				<div style="float:left">Switch makeup:&nbsp;</div>
					<form id="switchform">
						<select name="switchcontrol" size="1" style="background:rgba(0,0,0,0.154)" onChange="switch_style(this.options[this.selectedIndex].value)">
							<option value="makeup-gray" selected="selected">tabby--gray.css</option>
							<option value="makeup-solarizedlight">tabby--solarizedlight.css &nbsp;</option>
						</select>
					</form>
				</p>
				<p>Layout with the tabbed-menu on top <a href="index-toptabs.htm">tabby-toptabs-.css</a>.</p>
				<p>Still a pre v1.0.0, so expect some structure changes and many improvements.
					PRs are cool as long as you test well; please check out my `.todo.md` to see where I'm headed.
					New skins are welcome, but good chance my "API" (classes, file structure, selectors) will change.</p>
				<p>Thanks!</p>

				<h2>Configuration</h2>
				<p>The CSS is split into several files, for a more modular configuration.
					It is assumed the deployed website will do one of these:
					<ul>
						<li>Concate all css into one file before deployment, either by and or via build tool like <a href="https://github.com/mariocasciaro/gulp-concat-css">Gulp</a></li>
						<li>Concate all css after deployment, using <a href="https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#load-multiple-files-with-single-http-request">jsDelivr CDN</a> or a server-side solution.</li>
						<li>Link to each individual CSS file (not recomended outside of development)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				It has many color schemes, as well as animations on tab changes. It also has typography settings, a grid system, and, best of all, is completely responsive. It also has nice browser support, with support for IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. The code is pretty commented and you should be able to find and edit stuff with no problems. I am planning on improving on this even further, so it will only get better from here
